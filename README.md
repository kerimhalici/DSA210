Project Title  
Analyzing Factors Affecting Match Outcomes in European Football  

Motivation  
Football is a complex game influenced by many factors such as team form, player statistics, match location, and weather. Fans often claim that “home advantage” or “team fatigue” determines results — but is that statistically true?  
In this project, I aim to analyze how different measurable factors (like ball possession, shots on goal, yellow cards, home/away status, and average player ratings) affect the probability of a win, loss, or draw in European football matches.

Data Sources  
Main Dataset: [Kaggle European Soccer Database] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer) — includes over 25,000 matches from European leagues between 2008 and 2016.  
Enrichment: I plan to merge this dataset with another public source that contains weather data for match days (e.g. from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com)) to explore if weather affects match results.

Methods / Analysis Plan  
1. Data Collection & Cleaning — download and clean the Kaggle soccer dataset.  
2. Feature Engineering — extract numerical features like possession, goals, and cards; merge with weather data.  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — visualize trends such as home advantage or seasonal patterns.  
4. Hypothesis Testing — test whether home teams statistically win more.  
5. Modeling — apply logistic regression or random forest models to predict match outcomes.


Tools  
Python • Pandas • NumPy • Matplotlib • Scikit-learn • Jupyter  

Expected Outcomes  
- Insights into which variables most influence football results.  
- Visualization of trends like home advantage or weather effects.  
- A predictive model estimating match outcomes based on match statistics.  

Academic Integrity  
All sources will be cited. AI tools (like ChatGPT) were used to draft this proposal. Future reports will document all AI interactions explicitly.
